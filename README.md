# Exchange

This was a little project in Java. I used a **MVC structure** to develop an Exchange.   
It has 3 options: 
- EUR
- RON
- USD

The user can select between two in order to realize the conversion. The user can also switch with a button between the 2 options after he chooses them.  
He can insert in a text area the sum he wants to convert and the result will appear on the display after he presses a button. The result will also appear if the user selects another coin.
